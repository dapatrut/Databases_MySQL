# Databases_MySQL

In this project I practiced some basic SQL commands by creating various databases: pet clinic, computer store and Ikea.

Application: [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/).



Performed different queries inside the sql files: 

- I've specified in a comment above each group of instructions what each one is;

- I have created a link between the tables using primary and foreign keys;

- I created insert, update, delete, drop, alter and truncate instructions;

- I have created a set of selection statements that includes both the selection of all columns as well as selecting a set of columns;

- I created statements with simple filtering as well as with compound filtering both with the OR operator as well as the AND operator;

- I wrote filtering instructions based on the LIKE operator;

- I added statements containing aggregate functions and the GROUP BY clause;

- I used Joins in queries.
